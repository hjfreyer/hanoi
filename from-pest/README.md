# pest-ast

This is an in-development add-on to the pest parsing library.

Pest-ast provides a structured manner to go from the "dynamically typed" Pest Parse Tree
to a strongly typed (Abstract) Syntax Tree, as well as a derive to do so automatically.
In the future, it's planned to optionally additionally check the source grammar to statically
prevent issues that are currently detected at runtime.

In the _future_ ðŸ¦„, pest-ast may provide a way of defining grammar directly on the AST nodes.

## Note:

This crate is actually `from-pest`, which provides the trait framework for the said conversion.
[`pest-ast`](./derive/README.md) provides the actual derive for the conversion.

This README is the root of the repository for legacy reasons. This will be corrected in a future reorganization.

Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pest-parser/ast);
we try to keep it stocked with [good-first-issue](https://github.com/pest-parser/ast/labels/good%20first%20issue)
and [help-wanted](https://github.com/pest-parser/ast/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) opportunities.
If you have questions, don't be afraid to @ the author (CAD97)
[on Gitter](https://gitter.im/pest-parser/pest) or [on Discord](https://discord.gg/FuPE9JE).
The best thing you can probably do for this library currently is to use it!
More than anything else, I just want eyes on the interface trying it out and seeing where it shines and wher it falters.
